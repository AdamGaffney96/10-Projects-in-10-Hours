# 10 JS Projects in 10 Hours

The inspiration for this challenge came from this YouTube video: [10 Javascript Projects in 10 Hours - Coding Challenge by Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4).
I will not be holding myself to the 10 hour limit as I can't go straight, but I will be trying to complete them as quickly as possible and try to avoid feature creep. I will do exactly what I set for myself initially and not do anything too complex.
